# TCSS342 WordNet

WordNet is a semantic lexicon for the English language that is used extensively by computational linguists 
and cognitive scientists; for example, it was a key component in IBM's Watson. WordNet groups words 
into sets of synonyms called synsets and describes semantic relationships between them. One such 
relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym 
(more general synset). For example, a plant organ is a hypernym of carrot and plant organ is a hypernym 
of plant root.
