 *****************************************************************************/
For sysets I have used two HashMaps. One HashMap to store original ordering where key is Integer representing the sysnet ID and value is String representing synset noun. Another HashMap with opposite key value sequence where key is synset noun and value is synset id. The reason why I have chosen HashMap as the data structure is to have immidiate access to the key value sequence which does not requred iteration.

 *****************************************************************************/
For hypernyms I have dicided to use HashMap and LinkedList. The reason was to have immidiate access to Vertex by its name what in our case is sysnet id. Reading through the hypernyms file I get the hypernym ID and add it to the HashMap. ID works as an key and a value is a Vertex object with its ID. If the hypernym is already in the map I just update the list of its ancestors. If it does not in the HashMap add a new hypernym.

Description: To find shortest common ancestor I am using Depht-First Search algorightm. The reason is because the DFS has an advantage to traverse as fas as you can throgh the pass. While traversing the pass to the root I make an ArrayList of all visited ancestors for every hypernym. Then I compare ancestors for both hypernyms and get common ones. As soon as I get a list of common ancestors calculate the distance for every hypernym and every ancestor and find the shortest path.
